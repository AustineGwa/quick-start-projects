## Project for mapping data for pregnant women within an Org unit
![HealthIT Hackathon Day 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67046382/86454753-650e5100-bd28-11ea-8855-5a0dffb62b0a.png)

Data on the above indicators is collected using manual paper 
forms which are then submitted to the county for the entries 
to be made on excel spread-sheets there after discussed at 
the CHMT level. This double entry process makes the data prone
to errors and inconsistency .When the county stakeholders use
the extracted data they end up deducing in-accurate conclusions
from the report collected on the county populations.
This data is usually collected by Community Health Volunteers
who report on the locally done deliveries as well as pregnant 
women cases. There is a need to build a minimum viable solution
for the Community health workers involved in data collection. 
This will ensure accuracy when mapping data for pregnant women.
Keep in mind that data collection areas are resource constrained
and majority of the health officers involved are volunteers who
may only be willing to incur as minimal cost as possible.
